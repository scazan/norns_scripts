# norns_util_scripts
a very simple interface for the norns to execute some shell scripts direct from the norns

in a sort of alpha state and currently designed for my own use. more directions will come when it is ready to distribute.


two scripts are included,
one to backup tape data to a cloud provider,
another to backup my OP-Z to a cloud provider

both currently rely in installing rclone onto the norns itself via https://rclone.org/install/
